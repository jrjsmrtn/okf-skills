## Scope

This project is distributed as [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) /
plugin metadata for AI coding agents. It ships **no executable runtime and declares no
package dependencies**. The primary security considerations are the integrity of the
distributed content and the safety of any commands the skills instruct an agent to run.
